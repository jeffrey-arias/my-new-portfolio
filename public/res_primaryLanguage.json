      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I am Jeffrey Arias, a mobile and web software developer. I have more than 14 years of software developmenmt experience, both corporate and freelance. I also have experience in leading a development team, both in small and hardly mangeable numbers (thank God for Agile!). Javascript is my primary programming language, a.k.a. TypeScript without the safety nets. React and React-Native are my go-to front-end frameworks (libraries?). Of course I'm quite handy with CSS3 and HTML5 as well. I absolutely love using NextJS for SSR, I think it's currently the best at what it does out there. I'm most happy creating back-end apps using Node and Java, especially with GraphQL thrown in the mix to make API calls more streamlined. Serverless is the way to go for me, but you can never go wrong with Containers. Outside of work, I'm an easy going, and fun loving fella. I love dogs (especially my buddy Apollo here ðŸ‘ˆ), and am also quite the adrenaline junkie. I compete in triathlons/multisport to keep myself fit and could never pass up an opportunity to climb a mountain, ride some waves, or jump off of a plane.",
